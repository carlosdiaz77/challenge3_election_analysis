## Election-Audit Summary
-	
-	###We can see the data is very powerful and Iâ€™d like to add two more pieces of infarmation that could used in other elections

-	1.  The data cab be multi-grouped where in the firs level  is the county and in the second is the candidate. We would be able to see who won in each county.

-	- <img src = "Resources/proposal1" width= "500" >
-	
-	2.  The data can oslo be shown grouped mainly by candidate and then by county. In this way, we could see where each candidate had better results
-	
-	- <img src = "Resources/proposal2" width= "500" >

In summary, we can say Denver is the key element for this election, This County has 82% of the votes
